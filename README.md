# Medium-clone

This project replicates Medium's most basic features like publishing and reading blogs. The project is currently in the MVP stage (early prototype). More features are planned.

## Motivation

This project is a tribute to the [medium.com](https://medium.com/), the great place to read and write articles. The idea was to create our own Medium clone from scratch and learn what is needed to create one. We wanted to be closer to the original, so we decided to start on our own.

## Features

screens:
- home page
- write page
- blog writing page
- all blog showcase
- individual blog post showcase

## Tech Stack

- React 16, React-Router
- styles: CSS
- tools: Webpack 4, Babel, ESLint
- database: Firebase 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

*Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!*

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

## Local Development

After installing all dependencies (`npm i`) run this command:  

npm run dev

This will start both server and client in dev mode. The app is now available on localhost:3000.

## License

Design and assets mostly belong to [medium.com](https://medium.com/).
Redesigned a few stuffs though.
The app code is MIT licensed and free to use.
